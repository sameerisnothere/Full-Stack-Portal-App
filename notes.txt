tables: admin(name, email, password, phone, cnic, status, gender, isDeleted), student(name, email, password, phone, cnic, status, gender, isDeleted), teacher(name, email, password, phone, cnic, status, gender, isDeleted), course(name, teacherId, credit_hours, isDeleted), enrollment(courseId, StudentId),

i have a backend microservices architecture in nodejs. i have insert, delete, update, delete and authentication services and a gateway, 
each on a different route. im using mysql. apart from the gateway and authentication services, each of the services have only one route. 
i am making a student management system with student(name, email, password, phone, cnic, status, gender, isDeleted),
teacher(name, email, password, phone, cnic, status, gender, isDeleted), course(name, teacherId, credit_hours, isDeleted),
enrollment(studentId, courseId) and admin(name, email, password, phone, cnic, status, gender, isDeleted). my authentication is stateful token 
authentication using JWT with the token and its user stored in the db. gateway is in nodejs and the rest of the services in django.

authentication flow: login->token generated->token stored in db->api call made on CRUD route->checkAuth middleware sent with 
each CRUD req->checkAuth calls /me route with token->
/me decodes token and returns logged in user->checkAuth stores current user in x-user header and req.user->auth checkedd!!!->
req now successfully sent to CRUD route with headers(that contain authorization and x-user)->current user can be got from headers["x-user"]
or req.user in protected CRUD controller.

spread operator js
rest operator js
context processes (django templates)
for throttling, customise the user throttle.
build the react project
redux
make more components
middleware in django
course form component and general course page components
dunder functions
implement pgp to encrypt frontend payload. remove backend payload encryption.

"sameer"
("sameer")
("sameer",)
["sameer"]


**api requests made twice by frontend due to strict mode
**read response not encrypted as it is also being called inside the other microservices


django:
after installing django and drf,

start django project like this: django-admin startproject auth_service ./

create service app like this: py manage.py startapp authenticationserv

paste in the models file

to serve the react build locally:
serve -s dist -p 5173
